# Selenium web scraper

This is a simple example of web scraping using the selenium library for Chrome.

The aim of this notebook is to harvest URLs for course coupons from the website https://www.udemyfreebies.com/ which have may appeared over the last few days. The coupons become inactive after a period of time and therefore users would need to pay for courses if they were to enroll using an expired coupon. This script filters out such expired coupons and allows the user to select courses which they are interested in.
